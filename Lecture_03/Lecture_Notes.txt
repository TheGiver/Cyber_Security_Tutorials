Lecture Title: Cryptography
---------------------------
Definition of Cryptography:
Cryptography is the study and application of encryption/decryption algorithms. 
---------------------------
Definition of Encryption:
It is the process of converting human readable text into an unreadable form 
to prevent unwanted third parties from being able to steal information. 
---------------------------
Definition of Decryption:
Decryption is the process of converting the cyphertext back into its original 
human readable format. 
---------------------------
Cryptanalysis:
It is the art of studying ciphertexts with the purpose of analysing the encryption 
technique used to generate the text. This process will help with converting the text 
into its original decrypted format. 

Cryptanalysis depends on patterns that appear over and over again in the ciphertext and
attempting to make sense out of those patterns to be able to break the ciphertext into the 
decrypted text. 
---------------------------
Cryptology:
It is a combination of both cryptography and cryptanalysis. 
---------------------------
Encryption Algorithms:
(a) MD5
(b) SHA family
(c) RC4 
(d) BLOWFISH
Other algorithms can be found online. 
---------------------------
Cryptools:
It is a cryptanalysis tool that is used for educational purposes. 
This tool is used to attempt to breakdown the ciphertext back to its original 
format.
